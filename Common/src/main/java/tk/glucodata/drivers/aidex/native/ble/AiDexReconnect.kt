/**
 * Manages reconnection delays and failure tracking for a single AiDex sensor.
 *
 * Three independent failure tracks:
 *   1. **Soft reconnect** — normal disconnects or signal loss
 *   2. **Auth failure** — GATT status 5 / SMP auth rejected (exponential backoff)
 *   3. **Bond failure** — repeated SMP bond failures trigger lockout
 *
 * Also provides:
 *   - Service discovery watchdog timeout
 *   - Stale setup detection
 *   - Competing session delay (another app connected to sensor)
